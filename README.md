👋 Hi, I'm @kilo-bytez and welcome to my GitHub profile!

👀 I'm interested in cybersecurity, specifically in the areas of penetration testing and defense SOC. 
I'm always looking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning about risk management, incident response, and ethical hacking through industry-recognized certifications such as
CompTIA Security+, SOC-200, and OSCP. I also completed the Capslock Cybersecurity course, which gave me hands-on experience in areas such as penetration testing, 
vulnerability assessment, and threat intelligence.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to cybersecurity, especially those involving penetration testing and defense SOC.
I'm excited to work with other cybersecurity enthusiasts to develop innovative solutions that can help individuals 
nd organizations protect themselves against cyber threats.
